# Getting Started with Staking

**Stake USDTu tokens and earn automated yield through AI-powered investment strategies**

Pupas Protocol makes earning crypto yield simple: stake your USDTu tokens, receive LP tokens, and watch their value grow as our AI agents optimize your returns 24/7.

## Quick Start Guide

### Step 1: Prepare Your Wallet
- **Waves Wallet**: Use Waves.Exchange, Waves Keeper, or WX Network
- **Balance Needed**: Any amount of USDTu + small amount of WAVES for fees
- **Token Types**: USDTu (native) or USDT-ERC20 (bridged)

### Step 2: Connect to Platform
1. Visit [pupas.ai/staking](https://pupas.ai/staking)
2. Click "Connect Wallet"
3. Select your wallet type
4. Approve connection

### Step 3: Stake Your Tokens
1. Enter staking amount (any amount)
2. Select token type (USDTu or USDT-ERC20)
3. Review transaction details
4. Confirm staking transaction

### Step 4: Receive LP Tokens
- LP tokens minted to your wallet
- Represents your share of the staking pool
- Value increases as AI generates returns

## Supported Tokens

| Token | Network | Minimum Stake | Contract Address |
|-------|---------|---------------|------------------|
| USDTu | Waves | No minimum | `34N9YcEETLWn93qYQ64EsP1x89tSruJU44RrEMSXXEPJ` |
| USDT-ERC20 | Ethereum→Waves | No minimum | Bridged via gateway |

## How Staking Works

### The Process Flow
```
Your USDTu → Staking Contract → LP Tokens → AI Investment → Pool Growth → LP Price ↑
```

1. **Deposit**: Send USDTu to staking contract
2. **Mint**: Receive LP tokens at current price
3. **Invest**: AI agents use pooled funds for trading
4. **Update**: Oracle updates LP price hourly
5. **Withdraw**: Burn LP tokens for USDTu/USDT-ERC20 at current price

### LP Token Calculation
```
LP Tokens Received = Stake Amount ÷ Current LP Price
```

**Example**: Stake 1,000 USDTu when LP price is 1.05
- LP Tokens = 1,000 ÷ 1.05 = 952.38 LP tokens

## Yield Generation

### AI-Powered Returns
- **Protocol Analysis**: AI analyzes DeFi protocols on Waves 24/7
- **Strategy Execution**: Automated lending/staking based on ML models
- **Risk Management**: Position limits and stop-loss mechanisms
- **Diversification**: Spread across multiple investment strategies

### Price Appreciation Model
```
New LP Price = (Total Pool Value + Investment Gains) ÷ Total LP Supply
```

- **No Token Inflation**: Yield through price appreciation
- **Hourly Updates**: Oracle updates prices every 60 minutes
- **Compound Growth**: Gains reinvested automatically

## Fees and Costs

### Staking Fees
- **Protocol Fee**: 0.3% of stake amount (sent to treasury at staking)
- **Withdrawal Fee**: 0% (no fee to unstake)
- **Network Fee**: Standard Waves blockchain transaction fees

### Fee Transparency
All fees are clearly displayed before transaction confirmation. The protocol fee is deducted from your stake amount and sent to the treasury when you stake.

## Minimum Requirements

### Technical Requirements
- **Minimum Stake**: No minimum amount
- **Wallet**: Waves-compatible wallet
- **Network**: WAVES for transaction fees
- **Browser**: Modern browser with Web3 support

### Flexible Staking
- **Any Amount**: Stake whatever you're comfortable with
- **Accessibility**: Open to users of all budget sizes
- **Gradual Building**: Add to your position over time

## Staking Dashboard

### Key Metrics
- **Your Stake**: Total USDTu equivalent value
- **LP Tokens**: Number of LP tokens owned
- **Current APY**: Annualized percentage yield
- **LP Price**: Current LP token price
- **Total Earnings**: Profit since staking

### Real-time Updates
- **Price Updates**: LP price refreshes every hour
- **APY Calculation**: Based on 30-day rolling average
- **Performance Tracking**: Historical charts and analytics

## Security Measures

### Smart Contract Security
- **Audited Code**: Professional security audits completed
- **Timelock**: Administrative functions have delays
- **Multi-sig**: Critical operations require multiple signatures

### AI Agent Safeguards
- **Position Limits**: Maximum exposure per strategy
