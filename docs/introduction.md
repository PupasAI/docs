## How It Works

```
Stake USDTu/USDT-ERC20 → Get LP Tokens → AI Invests → LP Price ↑ → Withdraw Profit
```

1. **Stake**: Deposit USDTu/USDT-ERC20 tokens to receive LP tokens at current price
2. **AI Investment**: Investment agents find and invest in best lending/staking protocols
3. **Price Updates**: Oracle updates LP token price every hour based on pool performance
4. **Withdraw**: Burn LP tokens to receive USDTu/USDT-ERC20 at current LP price

## Formula

```
LP Token Price = (Total Pool Balance + Current Account Balance) / Total LP Tokens
Withdrawal Amount = LP Tokens × Current LP Price
```
