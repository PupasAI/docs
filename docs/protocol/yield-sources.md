# Yield Sources

**Where profits come from in Pupas Protocol's AI-powered lending and staking system**

Understanding yield sources helps you evaluate the sustainability and potential of returns. Pupas Protocol generates profits through DeFi lending, staking, and yield farming activities on Waves blockchain, not token inflation or unsustainable mechanisms.

## Primary Yield Sources

### 1. Lending Protocol Optimization

#### Smart Contract Lending
AI agents identify and invest in the highest-yield lending protocols on Waves blockchain:

```
Protocol A: USDT Lending = 8.5% APY
Protocol B: USDT Lending = 12.2% APY
Protocol C: USDT Lending = 9.8% APY
AI Selection: Protocol B (highest risk-adjusted return)
```

#### Execution Process
1. **Protocol Analysis**: AI evaluates lending protocol safety and yields
2. **Risk Assessment**: Smart contract audits and TVL analysis
3. **Allocation**: Distribute funds to optimal protocols
4. **Monitoring**: Continuous performance and security tracking

#### Revenue Characteristics
- **Yield Range**: 6-15% APY depending on market conditions
- **Risk Level**: Low-Medium (smart contract risk)
- **Liquidity**: High (most protocols allow instant withdrawal)
- **Scalability**: Increases with total value locked

### 2. Staking Strategy Optimization

#### Validator Selection and Delegation
Optimizing staking returns through intelligent validator selection:

#### Staking Targets
- **Waves Native Staking**: 4-6% APY through leasing
- **Governance Token Staking**: 8-15% APY in protocol tokens
- **Liquid Staking Derivatives**: 6-10% APY with liquidity

#### Optimization Features
- **Validator Analysis**: Performance, uptime, and commission evaluation
- **Delegation Distribution**: Spread across multiple validators
- **Reward Compounding**: Automatic reinvestment of staking rewards
- **Slashing Protection**: Diversification to minimize risk

### 3. DeFi Yield Farming Intelligence

#### Liquidity Mining Optimization
Providing liquidity to DeFi protocols for token rewards and trading fees:

#### Protocol Rewards Analysis
| Protocol | Asset Pair | Base APY | Token Rewards | Total APY |
|----------|------------|----------|---------------|-----------|
| Puzzle Swap | USDT/WAVES | 3.2% | 8.5% | 11.7% |
| WX Network | USDT/USDC | 2.8% | 6.2% | 9.0% |
| Waves DEX | USDT/NSBT | 4.1% | 7.3% | 11.4% |
| **AI Selection** | **Best Risk/Return** | | | **10-12%** |

#### AI Optimizations
- **Impermanent Loss Modeling**: Predict and minimize IL exposure
- **Reward Token Management**: Optimal timing for claiming and selling
- **Pair Selection**: Choose stable, high-volume pairs
- **Exit Strategy**: Automated withdrawal when yields decline

## Revenue Distribution

### Profit Allocation Model

#### From Gross Yields to User Returns


#### Fee Transparency
- **Protocol Fee**: 0.3% of stake amount (sent to treasury at staking)
- **No Performance Fee**: No additional fees on returns
- **No Withdrawal Fee**: Exit anytime without penalties
- **Network Fees**: Standard blockchain transaction costs

### Historical Yield Breakdown

#### Last 90 Days Performance
| Yield Source | Contribution | APY Impact | Risk Level |
|--------------|-------------|------------|------------|
| Lending Optimization | 40% | 4.8% | Low-Medium |
| Staking Strategies | 30% | 3.6% | Low |
| Yield Farming | 25% | 3.0% | Medium |
| **Total Portfolio** | **100%** | **12.0%** | **Low-Medium** |

## Yield Sustainability

### DeFi-Native Returns

#### Why Yields Are Sustainable
Pupas yields come from fundamental DeFi activities:

1. **Lending Demand**: Constant need for borrowing in DeFi
2. **Staking Rewards**: Blockchain security incentives
3. **Protocol Incentives**: Token rewards for liquidity provision
4. **AI Efficiency**: Machine learning optimizes allocation over time

#### Comparison with Other Models
| Model Type | Yield Source | Sustainability | Risk Level |
|------------|-------------|----------------|------------|
| Token Inflation | New token minting | Low (dilution) | Medium |
| Ponzi Schemes | New user deposits | None (collapse) | Extreme |
| Fixed Savings | Bank deposits | High (regulated) | Very Low |
| **AI DeFi** | **Protocol yields** | **High (market-based)** | **Low-Medium** |


## Market Conditions Impact
