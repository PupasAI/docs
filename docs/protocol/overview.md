# What is Pupas Protocol

**The first AI-powered staking protocol for USDT on Waves blockchain**

Pupas Protocol revolutionizes DeFi by combining artificial intelligence with automated lending and staking. Our AI agents analyze DeFi protocols 24/7, finding and investing in the best lending/staking opportunities on Waves blockchain to maximize returns for USDTu stakers.

## Core Concept

Traditional staking provides fixed rewards. Pupas Protocol delivers **dynamic yield through AI optimization**:

- Stake USDT tokens → Receive LP tokens
- AI agents invest pooled funds in best lending/staking protocols
- LP token price increases with investment profits
- Withdraw at any time with accumulated gains

## Why AI-Powered Staking?

### Traditional Staking Problems
- **Fixed APY**: Returns don't adapt to market conditions
- **Manual Management**: Users must actively manage positions
- **Limited Strategies**: Basic yield farming approaches
- **Market Inefficiency**: Human traders miss opportunities

### Pupas Protocol Solutions
- **Dynamic APY**: AI adjusts strategies based on market analysis
- **Automated Management**: Set-and-forget staking experience
- **Smart Protocol Selection**: Machine learning finds best lending/staking protocols
- **24/7 Optimization**: Never miss profitable opportunities

## Technical Architecture

```
Users → Stake USDTu → Smart Contract → AI Agents → Protocol Investments
  ↑                                                          ↓
LP Tokens ← Oracle Updates ← Pool Growth ← Lending/Staking Returns
```

### Smart Contract Layer
- **Staking Contract**: Handles deposits/withdrawals and LP token minting
- **Oracle Contract**: Updates LP prices hourly via `updateLpPrice`
- **Investment Contract**: Manages AI agent fund allocation

### AI Agent System
- **Investment Agent**: Finds and invests in best DeFi protocols
- **Risk Management Agent**: Monitors exposure and implements safeguards
- **Oracle Agent**: Aggregates price data from multiple sources
