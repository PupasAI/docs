The convergence of artificial intelligence and decentralized finance continues to evolve rapidly. As we enter the second half of 2025, **Pupas Protocol** is advancing the integration of sophisticated AI agents with automated yield strategies on the Waves blockchain.

Today, we're excited to share our comprehensive strategic roadmap for H2 2025 through 2026‚Äîa blueprint that will position Pupas Protocol as a leading AI-driven DeFi yield optimization platform.

## Where We Are Today: A Solid Foundation

Since our launch, **Pupas Protocol** has established itself as the first AI-powered staking protocol for USDT on Waves blockchain. Our current platform demonstrates the power of combining artificial intelligence with DeFi mechanics:

### üöÄ **Live Platform Features**
- **Core Staking Platform**: Seamless USDTu and USDT-ERC20 token staking with instant LP token minting
- **AI Investment Agents**: Automated fund allocation across Waves DeFi protocols, optimizing returns 24/7
- **Hourly Oracle Updates**: Most frequent price updates in DeFi via smart contract integration
- **Four-Agent Chat System**: Specialized AI assistants providing comprehensive user support
- **Zero Minimum Staking**: Accessible to all users regardless of budget size

### üìä **Current Performance Metrics**
- **Hourly LP Price Updates**: Real-time yield tracking through oracle integration
- **Multi-Token Support**: Native USDTu and bridged USDT-ERC20 compatibility
- **0.3% Protocol Fee**: Transparent, one-time fee structure with no hidden costs

Our foundation is solid, our technology is proven, and our community is growing. Now, it's time to scale.

## The Vision: Beyond Simple Staking

The DeFi landscape is evolving rapidly, and **Pupas Protocol** is well-positioned to participate in this evolution. Our roadmap focuses on creating an intelligent, interconnected ecosystem that maximizes value for every participant.

### üéØ **Strategic Objectives**
1. **Ecosystem Expansion**: Diversify revenue streams through strategic protocol integrations
2. **Advanced AI Strategies**: Implement sophisticated yield optimization techniques
3. **Cross-Chain Integration**: Expand beyond Waves to capture multi-chain opportunities
4. **Developer Ecosystem**: Build the infrastructure for AI-powered DeFi applications
5. **Security Enhancement**: Implement cutting-edge risk management systems

## Our Strategic Roadmap: Five Core Priorities

### üî• **Priority 1: Pool Ecosystem Expansion & Revenue Diversification**
**Timeline: Q3 2025**

The first pillar of our expansion focuses on creating multiple revenue streams within the Waves ecosystem:

**USDT Exchange Pool (Puzzle Swap)**
- Deploy dedicated liquidity pools for seamless USDT exchanges
- Capture exchange fees as a primary additional revenue stream
- Integrate with our conservative strategy for compound yield enhancement
- Implement automated liquidity management and fee optimization

**Waves Ecosystem Integration**
- Systematic evaluation and integration of high-yield Waves protocols
- Puzzle Swap AMM pools for diversified yield opportunities
- Native Waves lending protocols for stable yield generation

*Why this matters*: Diversification reduces risk while increasing potential returns. By expanding our yield sources, we create a more resilient protocol that can adapt to changing market conditions.

### üß† **Priority 2: Advanced AI Strategies & Puzzle Ranges Integration**
**Timeline: Q3-Q4 2025**

This is where Pupas Protocol differentiates itself from traditional DeFi platforms:

**Collateral-Based Yield Strategies**
- Utilize deposited USDT as collateral in Waves lending protocols
- Implement controlled leveraged yield farming with dynamic risk management
- Borrow volatile assets (WAVES, ETH, etc.) against stable collateral
- Automated collateral ratio management to prevent liquidations

**Puzzle Ranges Protocol Integration**
- Deploy custom USDT pools within Puzzle Ranges ecosystem
- Leverage concentrated liquidity mechanisms for enhanced capital efficiency
- Implement range-based automated market making strategies
- Optimize fee collection through intelligent range positioning

*Why this matters*: These advanced strategies can significantly boost yields while maintaining risk parameters through AI-powered monitoring and automated adjustments.

### üåê **Priority 3: UNITS Network Integration & Cross-Chain Foundation**
**Timeline: Q3 2025**

Expanding beyond Waves while maintaining our core strengths:

**UNITS Network Integration**
- Deploy smart contracts on UNITS blockchain
- Integrate with UniLend protocol for lending/borrowing operations
- Establish cross-chain asset bridging leveraging existing Waves-UNITS bridge
- Implement cross-chain yield optimization between ecosystems

**Cross-Chain Foundation Infrastructure**
- Automated cross-chain arbitrage detection between Waves and UNITS
- Multi-chain portfolio optimization for asset allocation
- Cross-chain liquidation protection and risk monitoring
- Seamless asset transfers with optimal bridge selection

*Why this matters*: Cross-chain integration multiplies our yield opportunities while positioning us for the multi-chain future of DeFi.

### üõ†Ô∏è **Priority 4: Public MCP Server ‚Äî Open Access for All**
**Timeline: Q4 2025**

We're developing a public Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that will serve as a universal data access point for AI agents. This will enable AI agents to query protocol data and interact with blockchain operations seamlessly.

**Public MCP Server**
- Open access for AI agents to query protocol data and execute blockchain interactions
- Standard API endpoints for integration with external AI agents and tools
- Real-time data access for up-to-date protocol information
- Secure authentication and rate limiting for reliable service

**Developer Resources**
- Public API documentation and integration guides
- SDKs for popular programming languages (Python, JavaScript)
- Sandbox environment for testing and development
- Community support channels

*Why this matters*: The MCP server will enable AI agents to access Pupas Protocol data and functionality as a standardized service, opening up new possibilities for AI-driven DeFi applications and integrations.

### üõ°Ô∏è **Priority 5: Advanced Security & Risk Management**
**Timeline: Q3/Q4 2025**

Security is paramount in DeFi, and our AI-powered approach enables enhanced protection:

**Automated Protection Systems**
- Liquidity withdrawal triggers based on pool utilization thresholds
- Dynamic threshold adjustment for changing market conditions
- Emergency withdrawal mechanisms for critical situations
- Circuit breakers for extreme market event protection
- Automated rebalancing based on market conditions

*Why this matters*: AI-powered security systems can react faster than any human operator, protecting user funds in real-time.
