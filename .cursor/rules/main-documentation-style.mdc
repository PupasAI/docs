# Main Documentation Style Guide

## Project Overview
This documentation covers Pupas Protocol - an AI-powered staking platform for USDTu tokens on Waves blockchain. The protocol uses artificial intelligence to optimize investment strategies, providing automated yield generation through sophisticated AI agents that analyze market conditions and execute trades.

## Target Audience

### Primary: AI-Curious Crypto Enthusiasts
- Technical crypto users interested in AI-powered DeFi
- Ages 25-45, experienced with staking and yield farming
- Seeking automated, intelligent investment strategies
- Want to understand how AI enhances crypto returns

### Secondary: DeFi Power Users
- Advanced DeFi participants looking for new opportunities
- Familiar with LP tokens, oracles, and protocol mechanics
- Interested in cutting-edge financial technology
- Value transparency and technical documentation

### Tertiary: Crypto Education Seekers
- Users wanting to learn about AI in cryptocurrency
- New to AI-powered protocols but crypto-experienced
- Seeking comprehensive guides and explanations
- Need marketing content and community support

## Language Style Guidelines

### Tone & Voice
- **Technical but accessible**: Use precise technical terminology while maintaining clarity
- **Authoritative**: Present information with confidence and expertise
- **Concise**: Every sentence should add value - no fluff
- **Action-oriented**: Use active voice and clear instructions
- **Future-focused**: Include roadmap references and development plans

### SEO Optimization
- Include primary keywords: "AI crypto", "USDTu staking", "AI-powered DeFi", "artificial intelligence blockchain"
- Use semantic keywords: "automated trading", "AI investment strategies", "machine learning DeFi", "intelligent yield farming"
- Structure content with clear H1, H2, H3 hierarchy
- Include meta descriptions for each page (max 160 characters)
- Target trending keywords: "AI revolution crypto 2024", "decentralized AI networks"

### Writing Principles
1. **Lead with value**: Start each section with the key benefit or outcome
2. **Use specific numbers**: APY rates, token amounts, time intervals, roadmap dates
3. **Include code examples**: Smart contract interactions, API calls
4. **Provide clear steps**: Numbered lists for processes
5. **Address risks upfront**: Transparency about potential issues
6. **Reference future plans**: Connect current features to roadmap items

### Technical Terminology
- LP Token: Liquidity Provider Token (always capitalize)
- Oracle: Price oracle system (explain on first use)
- APY: Annual Percentage Yield (spell out first time)
- Smart Contract: Capitalize when referring to specific contracts
- Waves Blockchain: Always capitalize properly
- AI Agent: Artificial Intelligence Agent (capitalize when referring to specific agents)
